# Rubix ML - Dota 2 Game Outcome Predictor
[Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that puts 10 players divided into 2 teams against each other. Each player controls a unique hero with abilities and its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Our objective is to build a classifier to predict the winning team based on hero matchup given a dataset of 102,944 individual matchups and their labeled outcomes. We'll employ the [Naive Bayes](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/classifiers/naive-bayes.html) algorithm as our base estimator and learn how to save the trained model for use in another process. We'll also test the model to see how well it can generalize what it has learned to new data.

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Training time:** Minutes
